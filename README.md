# Todo App

This is a Todo app that allows users to manage tasks, update due dates, and track overdue or upcoming tasks. The app uses React for the frontend, styled-components for styling, and integrates with a mock API to fetch and update data.

- **Node.js**

3. Install dependencies and start:
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

4. This will start the app on http://localhost:3000 by default.
